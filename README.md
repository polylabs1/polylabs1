Hey, welcome!

My name is Manuel, I am from beautiful Austria and I love Blender & 3D-Art! I am using github mostly for my Blender work and to maintain my own blog via github pages. I started to work in Blender as a hobby in 2018 (well, maybe there were some not-so-great, desperate tries before) and I am still in the process of learning - which I believe will never end. Blender is a 3D open source software and you can make breath-taking creations with it.

You can check most of my work on my [twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/polylabs1).

Thanks for the visit and enjoy your stay!
